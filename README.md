# Maze-Solver

"Maze-Solver" is an interactive application designed to visually demonstrate the intricacies and strategies of various algorithmic approaches to solving mazes. It is crafted using JavaScript and leverages the HTML grid system for graphical representation. This educational tool is particularly developed for classes at the University of São Paulo (USP) and showcases the differences and efficiencies between three distinct maze-solving strategies:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
2. **Best-First Greedy Search**
3. **Hill-Climbing Method**

## Features

- **Interactive Maze Grid**: The HTML grid system allows users to visually experience each step of the maze-solving process, offering real-time graphical feedback that is easy to understand and follow.
  
- **Multiple Solving Methods**: Users can learn, compare, and analyze the different approaches algorithms can take to solve the same maze, emphasizing the unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of each method.

- **Educational Tool**: Originally created for educational purposes at USP, it's a valuable resource for students and educators looking to understand complex algorithms in a simplified, visual manner.

## How to Use
Just open the `index.html` in your browser to start the application. Select a maze, choose one of the three methods, and watch the algorithm in action as it navigates through the maze grid.
